**Answer: A. [5, 2, 1, 8, 9]**

Explanation: The `Arrays.sort()` method sorts the specified range of the array in ascending order. In this case, the range is from index 1 to index 3 (the range is inclusive of the beginning index but exclusive of the ending index), which contains the elements 2, 8, and 1. After sorting, the range becomes [1, 2, 8], so the resulting array is [5, 1, 2, 8, 9].


# 🚀 Methods in Java 🚀

Welcome to the exciting world of Java programming! One of the most important concepts in Java is **Methods**. 🤖

Methods are like superpowers that allow you to perform specific tasks in your Java program. 💪 They are blocks of code that can be called over and over again, saving you time and effort. 🏋️‍♀️

In Java, you can create your own methods or use built-in methods provided by the language. 🤓 You can pass arguments to methods, and methods can return values. 🎁

With methods, you can break down complex programs into smaller, more manageable pieces, making your code more organized and easier to read. 🔍

So buckle up and get ready to learn all about methods in Java. It's going to be a wild ride! 🤠

# 🧑‍💻 Exploring Methods in Java 🧑‍💻

In Java, a method is a block of code that performs a specific task. It can be called from anywhere in the program, allowing you to reuse code and make your programs more modular. 🤖

## 📝 Creating a Method

To create a method, you must define it within a class. Here's an example of a simple method:

**java code**

![](https://i.gyazo.com/64d66ce4eaa90665a857227aa43a1b56.png)



In this example, we've created a method called `sayHello()` within the `MyClass` class. The `static` keyword means that the method can be called without creating an instance of the class. The method simply prints "Hello World!" to the console.

## 🧐 Calling a Method

Now that we've created our method, we can call it from anywhere in the program. Here's how to call our `sayHello()` method:

**java code**

![](https://i.gyazo.com/46dc6f71dfc6720a47374d473183e6e8.png)


In this example, we've created a `Main` class with a `main()` method. We're calling the `sayHello()` method from within the `main()` method. When we run this program, it will output "Hello World!" to the console.

## 🎁 Passing Arguments to a Method

Methods can also accept parameters, allowing you to pass values to the method. Here's an example:

**java code**

![](https://i.gyazo.com/be5449abef2d4869fafac0dabddc6f37.png)



In this example, we've created a method called `printNumber()` that accepts an integer parameter called `num`. The method simply prints the value of `num` to the console.

To call this method and pass a value to it, we would do the following:

**java code**

![](https://i.gyazo.com/b761abe912e484b9fe027b58642b3703.png)

This would output "The number is 42" to the console.

## 🎉 Returning Values from a Method

Methods can also return values, allowing you to use the result of a calculation or operation in your program. Here's an example:

**java code**

![](https://i.gyazo.com/7dc44cf034747cb066846d49b85e0653.png)


In this example, we've created a method called `addNumbers()` that accepts two integer parameters called `num1` and `num2`. The method calculates the sum of these two numbers and returns the result.

To call this method and use the result, we would do the following:

**java code**

![](https://i.gyazo.com/fb5ceef0efc192e3a1bb433f88adce40.png)



This would **output** "The result is 30" to the console.

# 🎁 Using Return Values from Methods in Java 🎁

In Java, methods can return values, allowing you to use the result of a calculation or operation in your program. 🤓

## 🤔 Why Use Return Values?

Return values are useful when you need to perform a calculation or operation and use the result in your program. For example, if you need to add two numbers together and use the result in another calculation, you can create a method that returns the sum of the two numbers.

## 📝 Creating a Method That Returns a Value

To create a method that returns a value, you need to specify the data type of the return value in the method signature. Here's an example:

**java code**

![](https://i.gyazo.com/baba11b9afab1cd59e0d262dc69c2d40.png)


In this example, we've created a method called `addNumbers()` that accepts two integer parameters called `num1` and `num2`. The method calculates the sum of these two numbers and returns the result as an integer.

## 🧐 Calling a Method That Returns a Value

To call a method that returns a value, you need to assign the result to a variable of the appropriate data type. Here's an example:

**java code**

![](https://i.gyazo.com/1f0a6c1a2bbdd8e5c7b4a1413dc27ef4.png)


In this example, we've called the `addNumbers()` method from the `Main` class and assigned the result to a variable called `result`. We then print the result to the console using `System.out.println()`.

## 🤯 Using Return Values in Other Calculations

Return values can be used in other calculations or operations. Here's an example:

**java code**

![](https://i.gyazo.com/badf47fc661da6dcffafcb777a1c16e8.png)



In this example, we've assigned the result of the `addNumbers()` method to a variable called `result1`. We then use that value to calculate `result2`, which is `result1` multiplied by 2. We print the result to the console using `System.out.println()`.
