# Data Types and Operators in Java 🚀

### Data Types in Java 📊

Data types in Java are used to define the type of data that can be stored in a variable. Java has two types of data types: Primitive data types and Reference data types.

1.  **Primitive Data Types** 🧰 Java has eight primitive data types: byte, short, int, long, float, double, char, and boolean. These data types are used to represent the most basic types of data in Java.
    
2.  **Reference Data Types** 🗂️ Java has four reference data types: Class, Interface, Array, and String. Reference data types are used to represent more complex data structures.
    

### Operators in Java 🎯

Operators in Java are symbols that are used to perform operations on variables and values. Java has several types of operators, including arithmetic, relational, logical, bitwise, assignment, and conditional operators.

1.  **Arithmetic Operators** ➕➖✖️➗ Arithmetic operators are used to perform arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus.
    
2.  **Relational Operators** ➡️<br>➡️= Relational operators are used to compare two values or variables. The result of the comparison is a boolean value (true or false).
    
3.  **Logical Operators** 🔢👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Logical operators are used to combine two or more boolean expressions and evaluate the resulting expression as true or false.
    
4.  **Bitwise Operators** 🔢🤖 Bitwise operators are used to perform bit-level operations on variables.
    
5.  **Assignment Operators** 👈🔢 Assignment operators are used to assign a value to a variable.

# 🍫`byte` Primitive Data Type

Byte is one of the eight primitive data types in Java. It is an 8-bit signed two's complement integer, which means it can represent values from -128 to 127. 🔢

In Java, bytes are often used when dealing with binary data, such as reading and writing files or communicating with hardware devices. 💾

Here are three examples of how bytes can be used in Java:

### Example 1: Storing a byte value in a variable
**Java code:**


![](https://i.gyazo.com/af547651caece6c96b542b99c37c0659.png)

**Output:**
**`10`** 

In this example, we declare a variable named `myByte` and assign it a value of 10. 
We then print the value of `myByte` using the `System.out.println()` method. 📝

### Example 2: Reading bytes from a file

**Java code:**


![](https://i.gyazo.com/75e4d1031624457cff9ca2b51988c885.png)

**Output:**
**`72 101 108 108 111 32 87 111 114 108 100`** 

In this example, we read bytes from a file named "file.txt" using the `FileInputStream` class. We use a while loop to read each byte until we reach the end of the file (which is indicated by a value of -1). We then print each byte value to the console. 📁

### Example 3: Converting a byte array to a string
**Java code:**


![](https://i.gyazo.com/6a69d2ed4bbf237a324b03459d065ec6.png)

# 🧊`float` Primitive Data Type

In computer programming, a `float` (short for "floating-point number") is a primitive data type used to represent numbers with decimal points. Floats are often used to store values that require a greater range than integers, and can be used to represent both very small and very large numbers.

💻 In most programming languages, floats are represented using a fixed number of bits. Typically, this is either 32 or 64 bits, with the latter being more precise but also requiring more memory.

👨‍🏫 Floats can be written in scientific notation, using the letter "e" to indicate the power of 10. For example, `1.23e6` is equivalent to `1,230,000`.

## Examples of Float Values 💡

**-   `3.14159`:** This is a standard value for pi, which cannot be represented exactly using any finite number of decimal places. 🥧
    
**-   `2.71828`:** This is a standard value for e, which is another mathematical constant that cannot be represented exactly using any finite number of decimal places. 📈
    
**-   `0.00001`:** This is a very small value that might be used to represent a measurement in micrometers or nanometers. 🔬
    
**-   `1000000.0`:** This is a very large value that might be used to represent a distance in kilometers or a mass in metric tons. 🌎
    
**-   `1.234567890123456789`:** This is an example of a very precise float that might be used in scientific or financial calculations. 💰

# 💻 Reference Data Types in Java Programming Language

In Java programming language, reference data types are used to refer to objects rather than values. Unlike primitive data types, which hold a specific value such as a number or a character, reference data types hold a reference or memory address of an object that is stored elsewhere in the computer's memory. 🧠

![](https://i.gyazo.com/203fcb7d37cf99176a1459f41b2cc4f4.png)



## 🚀 Examples of Reference Data Types in Java

Reference data types include objects, arrays, and classes. They are often created using the `new` keyword, which allocates memory for the object and returns a reference to that memory location. Here are some examples of reference data types in Java:

### 📦 Objects

Objects are instances of a class that contains both data and methods to operate on that data. An object is created by invoking the constructor of a class using the `new` keyword. Here is an example:

**java code**

![](https://i.gyazo.com/469861db00c3ff5a70d8bf57efa9f026.png)



### 📚 Arrays

An array is a collection of variables of the same data type. In Java, arrays are objects and are created using the `new` keyword. Here is an example:

**java code**

![](https://i.gyazo.com/91cf778132233bee9cb9c711c33ab766.png)



### 🏫 Classes

A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the properties and behaviors of an object. A class is created using the `class` keyword. Here is an example:

**java code**

# 🤔 Differences between Primitive and Reference Data Types

Here is a table summarizing the differences between primitive data types and reference data types in Java:


| Primitive Data Types                                      | Reference Data Types                                |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Hold a specific value                                     | Hold a memory address                              |
| Stored on the stack                                       | Stored on the heap                                  |
| Include boolean, byte, char, short, int, long, float, and double | Include objects, arrays, and classes |
| Initialized with a default value                          | Initialized to null                                 |
| Passed by value                                           | Passed by reference                                 |


In Java, when a reference data type is passed as an argument to a method, a copy of the reference is passed, not a copy of the object itself. This means that changes made to the object inside the method are reflected outside the method as well. 😲

## 💡 Example Java Code

Here is an example Java code that demonstrates the use of reference data types:
