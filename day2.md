# 🍫`byte` Primitive Data Type

Byte is one of the eight primitive data types in Java. It is an 8-bit signed two's complement integer, which means it can represent values from -128 to 127. 🔢

In Java, bytes are often used when dealing with binary data, such as reading and writing files or communicating with hardware devices. 💾

Here are three examples of how bytes can be used in Java:

### Example 1: Storing a byte value in a variable
**Java code:**
``` java
public class ByteExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Storing a byte value in a variable
        byte myByte = 10;
        System.out.println(myByte);
    }
}
```

**Output:**
**`10`** 

In this example, we declare a variable named `myByte` and assign it a value of 10. 
We then print the value of `myByte` using the `System.out.println()` method. 📝

### Example 2: Reading bytes from a file

**Java code:**
``` java
import java.io.FileInputStream;
import java.io.IOException;

public class ReadBytesExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Reading bytes from a file
        try (FileInputStream input = new FileInputStream("file.txt")) {
            int byteValue;
            while ((byteValue = input.read()) != -1) {
                System.out.print(byteValue + " ");
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```




**Output:**
**`72 101 108 108 111 32 87 111 114 108 100`** 

In this example, we read bytes from a file named "file.txt" using the `FileInputStream` class. We use a while loop to read each byte until we reach the end of the file (which is indicated by a value of -1). We then print each byte value to the console. 📁

### Example 3: Converting a byte array to a string
**Java code:**
``` java
public class ByteArrayToStringExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Converting a byte array to a string
        byte[] byteArray = {72, 101, 108, 108, 111}; // ASCII values for "Hello"
        String str = new String(byteArray);
        System.out.println(str);
    }
}
```

**Output:**
**`Hello`** 

In this example, we declare a byte array containing the ASCII values for the letters "Hello". We then create a new `String` object using the byte array, and print the resulting string to the console. 💬

Overall, bytes are useful for storing small integers and dealing with binary data in Java. 👍

## Applications of `byte` Primitive Data Type

🧠 **Memory efficiency:** The byte data type requires less memory than other integer types such as int or long. If you have a large amount of data to store, using byte can help you save memory. 💾💿🧮

🌐 **Network communication:** When sending data over a network, using byte can be more efficient than using other integer types. This is because the size of the data being sent can be reduced, leading to faster data transfer. 📡💬💻

🖼️ **Image processing:** In image processing, images are represented as matrices of pixel values. Each pixel in an image can have a value ranging from 0 to 255. Since the byte data type can hold integer values from -128 to 127, it can be used to represent each pixel in an image. 📷🌈🔍

#  📏`short` Primitive Data Type
👋 In Java, the `short` data type is a primitive data type that can hold integer values ranging from -32,768 to 32,767. It is a 16-bit signed two's complement integer. Here are some 🔥 examples of using the `short` data type in Java:

#### 💡 Example 1: Declaring a `short` variable and assigning a value to it.

**Java code**

``` java
public class ShortVariableExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Declaring a short variable and assigning a value to it
        short temperature = -10;
        System.out.println("The temperature is: " + temperature);
    }
}
```


👉 In this example, a `short` variable named `temperature` is declared and assigned the value `-10`. The value of the `temperature` variable is then printed to the console along with a message.

#### 💡 Example 2: Performing arithmetic operations on `short` variables.

**Java code**

``` java
public class ShortArithmeticExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Performing arithmetic operations on short variables
        short a = 100;
        short b = 200;
        short sum = (short) (a + b);
        short difference = (short) (b - a);
        short product = (short) (a * b);
        short quotient = (short) (b / a);
        
        // Printing the results
        System.out.println("Sum: " + sum);
        System.out.println("Difference: " + difference);
        System.out.println("Product: " + product);
        System.out.println("Quotient: " + quotient);
    }
}
```



👉 In this example, two `short` variables `a` and `b` are declared and assigned the values `100` and `200`, respectively. Arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division are performed on these variables and the results are stored in `short` variables `sum`, `difference`, `product`, and `quotient`. 🤓 Note that when performing arithmetic operations on `short` variables, it is important to cast the result to `short` to prevent overflow. The results are then printed to the console.

#### 💡 Example 3: Using `short` in a for loop.

**Java code**

``` java
public class ShortForLoopExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Using short in a for loop
        short n = 10;
        for (short i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            System.out.print(i + " ");
        }
    }
}
```


👉 In this example, a `short` variable `n` is declared and assigned the value `10`. A `for` loop is used to iterate from `1` to `n` using a `short` variable `i`. The value of `i` is printed to the console on each iteration, separated by a space. 🚀

Overall, the `short` data type in Java is useful for storing integer values within a limited range, and can be used in a variety of programming scenarios, including arithmetic operations, loop control, and variable declarations. 🤖

# 🤖`long` Primitive Data Type

In Java, the long data type is a 🐻‍❄️ primitive data type 🐻‍❄️ that can hold 🙀 integer values ranging from -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807 🙀. It is a 64-bit signed two's complement integer.

🔍 Here are some important things to note about the long data type in Java:

🎯 **Range:** The long data type can hold integer values ranging from -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807, inclusive. 
💾 **Memory usage:** The long data type uses 8 bytes of memory, twice that of the int data type. 
🔢 **Default value:** The default value of a long variable is 0L (note the L at the end indicating a long value). 
🔣 **Operations:** Arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division can be performed on long variables. 
🛡️ **Literal:** To use a long literal in Java, it must be appended with the letter L or l to avoid compilation errors.

👀 Here are some examples of using the long data type in Java:

#### 👨‍💻 Example 1: 
Declaring a long variable and assigning a value to it.

**java code**

``` java
public class LongVariableExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Declaring a long variable and assigning a value to it
        long population = 7_000_000_000L;
        System.out.println("The world population is: " + population);
    }
}
```



In this example, a long variable named population is declared and assigned the value 7 billion (7,000,000,000). The value of the population variable is then printed to the console along with a message.

#### 👨‍💻 Example 2: 
Performing arithmetic operations on long variables.

**java code**



``` java
public class LongArithmeticExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Performing arithmetic operations on long variables
        long a = 1234567890123L;
        long b = 9876543210987L;
        long sum = a + b;
        long difference = a - b;
        long product = a * b;
        long quotient = a / b;

        // Printing the results
        System.out.println("Sum: " + sum);
        System.out.println("Difference: " + difference);
        System.out.println("Product: " + product);
        System.out.println("Quotient: " + quotient);
    }
}
```



In this example, two long variables a and b are declared and assigned values that exceed the range of an int. Arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division are performed on these variables and the results are stored in long variables sum, difference, product, and quotient. The results are then printed to the console.

#### 👨‍💻 Example 3: 
Using long in a loop.

**java code**


``` java
public class LongLoopExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Using long in a loop
        long n = 10_000_000_000L;
        for (long i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            System.out.print(i + " ");
        }
    }
}
```



In this example, a long variable n is declared and assigned the value 10 billion (10,000,000,000). A for loop is used to iterate from 1 to n using a long variable i. The value of i is printed to the console on each iteration, separated by a space.

🧐 Overall, the long data type in Java is useful for storing integer values that exceed the range of an int, and can be used in a variety of programming scenarios, including arithmetic operations, loop control, and variable declarations. However, it should be noted that using long variables can result in increased memory usage compared to int variables, so their use should be carefully considered in memory-constrained environments.

## Applications of `long` Primitive Data Type

In programming, the long primitive data type is commonly used in a variety of applications. Here are some of the most common use cases:

⏱️ **Timing:** The long data type is often used to measure time in milliseconds or nanoseconds. This is particularly useful in performance testing and benchmarking. ⏰

🧮 **Large numbers:** The long data type can store very large numbers, which is useful in scientific and mathematical calculations that involve very large values. 🔢

💾 **File sizes:** The long data type can represent file sizes, which is useful in file handling and disk operations. 💽

💻 **Memory addresses**: The long data type can store memory addresses, which are important in systems programming and low-level languages. 🖥️

🆔 **Unique identifiers:** The long data type can generate unique identifiers, such as order numbers or transaction IDs, which are used in databases and other systems. 🔑

Overall, the long data type is valuable in scenarios that involve very large numbers or require precise timing. Its large range allows for flexibility in programming, and it can be used in a variety of applications. 🤖👨‍💻


# 🧊`float` Primitive Data Type

In computer programming, a `float` (short for "floating-point number") is a primitive data type used to represent numbers with decimal points. Floats are often used to store values that require a greater range than integers, and can be used to represent both very small and very large numbers.

💻 In most programming languages, floats are represented using a fixed number of bits. Typically, this is either 32 or 64 bits, with the latter being more precise but also requiring more memory.

👨‍🏫 Floats can be written in scientific notation, using the letter "e" to indicate the power of 10. For example, `1.23e6` is equivalent to `1,230,000`.

## Examples of Float Values 💡

**-   `3.14159`:** This is a standard value for pi, which cannot be represented exactly using any finite number of decimal places. 🥧
    
**-   `2.71828`:** This is a standard value for e, which is another mathematical constant that cannot be represented exactly using any finite number of decimal places. 📈
    
**-   `0.00001`:** This is a very small value that might be used to represent a measurement in micrometers or nanometers. 🔬
    
**-   `1000000.0`:** This is a very large value that might be used to represent a distance in kilometers or a mass in metric tons. 🌎
    
**-   `1.234567890123456789`:** This is an example of a very precise float that might be used in scientific or financial calculations. 💰
    

🚨 One important thing to note about floats is that they are not always precise. This is because they are represented using a fixed number of bits, which means that some values may be rounded or truncated. 
In addition, some operations with floats can result in rounding errors, which can accumulate over time and lead to inaccuracies in calculations. 
Therefore, it is important to be careful when working with floats, especially in situations where high precision is required.

#### Example 1: Calculating the Area of a Circle

**java code**



![](https://i.gyazo.com/450b006156021c2e01dbed66b51b6e36.png)



In this example, the program prompts the user to enter the radius of a circle, and then uses the formula `area = pi * r^2` to calculate the area of the circle. The `radius` and `area` variables are both declared as floats.


# `double` Primitive Data Type 🚀

In computer programming, `double` is a primitive data type that represents floating-point numbers with double precision. It is similar to the `float` data type, but with twice the precision! 💪

📊 A `double` is represented using 64 bits (8 bytes) of memory, which allows it to store 15-17 significant digits with a range of approximately 10^-308 to 10^308. This makes it an excellent choice for scientific and engineering calculations that require high-precision arithmetic.

 #### Example 1:
Calculating the Area of a Circle

**java code**

``` java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class CircleArea {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.print("Enter the radius of the circle: ");
        float radius = input.nextFloat();
        double area = Math.PI * Math.pow(radius, 2);

        System.out.println("The area of the circle is: " + area);
    }
}
```



This code calculates the area of a circle with a given radius of 5.0. The `Math.PI` constant represents the value of pi, and the `Math.pow` method is used to raise the radius to the power of 2.

#### Example 2:
Temperature Conversion

**java code**

``` java
public class TemperatureConversion {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        double celsius = 37.5;
        double fahrenheit = (celsius * 9 / 5) + 32;

        System.out.println("Temperature in Celsius: " + celsius);
        System.out.println("Temperature in Fahrenheit: " + fahrenheit);
    }
}
```





This code converts a temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit. The formula for the conversion is `(Celsius * 9/5) + 32`, where `Celsius` is the temperature in degrees Celsius.

 #### Example 3:
Calculating the Hypotenuse of a Right-Angled Triangle

**java code**

``` java
public class HypotenuseCalculation {

# `char` Primitive Data Type 🔤

In Java, the `char` data type is used to represent a single character, such as a letter, digit, or symbol. It's like a 🎁 gift box 🎁 that holds a single 🎨 color 🎨 or 🌟 star 🌟 from the vast 🌎 universe 🌎 of Unicode characters.

The `char` data type is a 16-bit unsigned integer, which means it can hold values from 0 to 65,535 (2^16 - 1). This range allows it to store characters from many different writing systems, including 🇺🇸 Latin, 🇷🇺 Cyrillic, 🇨🇳 Chinese, and 🇯🇵 Japanese.

To declare a `char` variable in Java, you can use the following syntax:

**java code**


``` java
public class CharVariableExample1 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Declaring a char variable and assigning a character to it
        char myChar = 'A';
        System.out.println("The character is: " + myChar);
    }
}
```


Here, the variable `myChar` is assigned the character 'A'. Note that characters in Java are enclosed in single quotes (' '), while strings are enclosed in double quotes (" ").

You can also use the Unicode value of a character to assign it to a `char` variable, like this:

**java code**

``` java
public class CharVariableExample2 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Using Unicode value to assign a character to a char variable
        char myChar = '\u005A';
        System.out.println("The character is: " + myChar);
    }
}
```


Here, the variable `myChar` is assigned the character 'Z', which has a Unicode value of 0x005A. It's like a secret code 🔐 that unlocks the 🚪 door 🚪 to a specific character in the Unicode universe.

The `char` data type can be used in many ways in Java, such as representing letters and symbols in strings, inputting single characters from the user, and displaying characters on the screen. Let's see some examples:

**java code**



``` java
public class CharUsageExamples {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Using char in different ways
        char myChar = '❤';
        String stringWithChar = "I love " + myChar;
        System.out.println(stringWithChar);

        // Accepting a single character input from the user
        char inputChar = 'a'; // Assuming 'a' is the input from the user
        System.out.println("The user entered: " + inputChar);

        // Storing and printing emojis using char array
        char[] emojis = {'😊', '🚀', '🎉'};
        for (char emoji : emojis) {
            System.out.print(emoji + " ");
        }
    }
}
```


In the first example, the `char` variable `myChar` holds the ❤️ symbol, which is then inserted into a string. In the second example, the `char` variable `inputChar` is used to store a single character entered by the user. Finally, in the third example, the `char` data type is used to store individual letters of a string in an array, which are then printed to the screen as emojis.

In conclusion, the `char` data type is a versatile and colorful element in Java programming that can add a lot of 💫 sparkle 💫 to your code.

## Applications of  `char` Data Type

🌟 The `char` data type in Java has many 🎯 applications, including:

🔹 **String manipulation:** Used to manipulate individual characters in strings using methods such as `charAt()`.

🔹 **Input/output operations:** Used to read and write single characters to and from files, streams, and the console. 📂💻

🔹 **Password fields:** Commonly used to store passwords as arrays of characters for security purposes. 🔒🤐

🔹 **Graphics and user interface:** Used to display symbols, icons, and other visual elements on the screen. 🎨🖼️

# `Boolean` Primitive Data Type 🔍

In Java, the `boolean` primitive data type is used to represent a logical value, which can only be either **true** or **false**. ✅ ❌

## Declaration and Initialization 📝

The `boolean` primitive data type can be declared using the keyword `boolean`, followed by the variable name. It can be initialized with either **true** or **false**. ⌨️

**java code**


``` java
public class BooleanDeclarationExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Declaration and initialization of a boolean variable
        boolean isJavaFun = true;
        boolean isFishTasty = false;

        System.out.println("Is Java fun? " + isJavaFun);
        System.out.println("Is fish tasty? " + isFishTasty);
    }
}
```



## Operations 🔍

Java provides several operators to perform logical operations on boolean values. The most commonly used operators are:

1.  **Logical AND (`&&`) operator:** It returns **true** if both the operands are true, otherwise, it returns **false**. 🔀

**java code**

``` java
public class LogicalAndOperatorExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Logical AND (&&) operator
        boolean a = true;
        boolean b = false;
        System.out.println(a && b); // Output: false
    }
}
```


2.  **Logical OR (`||`) operator:** It returns **true** if either of the operands is true, otherwise, it returns **false**. 🔀

**java code**

``` java
public class LogicalOrOperatorExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Logical OR (||) operator
        boolean a = true;
        boolean b = false;
        System.out.println(a || b); // Output: true
    }
}
```


3.  **Logical NOT (`!`) operator:** It returns the opposite of the operand's value. If the operand is **true**, it returns **false**, and if the operand is **false**, it returns **true**. 🔀

**java code**

``` java
public class LogicalNotOperatorExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Logical NOT (!) operator
        boolean a = true;
        boolean b = false;
        System.out.println(!a); // Output: false
        System.out.println(!b); // Output: true
    }
}
```


## Usage 💻

Boolean values are used in conditional statements to determine the flow of the program. For example, if a condition is **true**, the program will execute one set of instructions, and if the condition is **false**, the program will execute a different set of instructions. 🔍

**java code**

``` java
public class BooleanConditionalExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Using boolean in conditional statements
        boolean isLightOn = true;

        if (isLightOn) {
            System.out.println("The light is on");
        } else {
            System.out.println("The light is off");
        }
    }
}
```


In conclusion, the `boolean` primitive data type in Java is a simple yet important data type that is used to represent logical values. It is widely used in conditional statements and logical operations. ✨

# 💻 Reference Data Types in Java Programming Language

In Java programming language, reference data types are used to refer to objects rather than values. Unlike primitive data types, which hold a specific value such as a number or a character, reference data types hold a reference or memory address of an object that is stored elsewhere in the computer's memory. 🧠

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/129722425/231403423-a7bb75cf-1ea1-4a6c-a996-ccfc5b9e2262.png)


## 🚀 Examples of Reference Data Types in Java

Reference data types include objects, arrays, and classes. They are often created using the `new` keyword, which allocates memory for the object and returns a reference to that memory location. Here are some examples of reference data types in Java:

### 📦 Objects

Objects are instances of a class that contains both data and methods to operate on that data. An object is created by invoking the constructor of a class using the `new` keyword. Here is an example:

**java code**

``` java
public class ObjectExample {
    String name;

    public ObjectExample(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    public void printName() {
        System.out.println("Name: " + this.name);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ObjectExample obj = new ObjectExample("John");
        obj.printName();
    }
}
```


### 📚 Arrays

An array is a collection of variables of the same data type. In Java, arrays are objects and are created using the `new` keyword. Here is an example:

**java code**

``` java
public class ArrayExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Creating an array
        int[] numbers = new int[5];
        numbers[0] = 1;
        numbers[1] = 2;
        numbers[2] = 3;
        numbers[3] = 4;
        numbers[4] = 5;

        // Accessing and printing array elements
        for (int i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
            System.out.print(numbers[i] + " ");
        }
    }
}
```


### 🏫 Classes

A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the properties and behaviors of an object. A class is created using the `class` keyword. Here is an example:

**java code**


``` java
public class MyClass {
    // Properties
    String color;
    int size;

    // Constructor
    public MyClass(String color, int size) {
        this.color = color;
        this.size = size;
    }

    // Method
    public void display() {
        System.out.println("Color: " + color);
        System.out.println("Size: " + size);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Creating an object of the class
        MyClass obj = new MyClass("Red", 5);
        obj.display();
    }
}
```



# 🤔 Differences between Primitive and Reference Data Types

Here is a table summarizing the differences between primitive data types and reference data types in Java:


| Primitive Data Types                                      | Reference Data Types                                |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Hold a specific value                                     | Hold a memory address                              |
| Stored on the stack                                       | Stored on the heap                                  |
| Include boolean, byte, char, short, int, long, float, and double | Include objects, arrays, and classes |
| Initialized with a default value                          | Initialized to null                                 |
| Passed by value                                           | Passed by reference                                 |


In Java, when a reference data type is passed as an argument to a method, a copy of the reference is passed, not a copy of the object itself. This means that changes made to the object inside the method are reflected outside the method as well. 😲

## 💡 Example Java Code

Here is an example Java code that demonstrates the use of reference data types:

**java code**


``` java
public class ReferenceDataTypeExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Creating a reference variable and assigning an object to it
        String str = new String("Hello, Java!");

        // Using methods of the String class
        System.out.println("Length of the string: " + str.length());
        System.out.println("Character at index 7: " + str.charAt(7));

        // Another example using the Math class
        double squareRoot = Math.sqrt(25);
        System.out.println("Square root of 25: " + squareRoot);
    }
}
```



**Output:**

``` mathematica
Length of the string: 11
Character at index 7: J
Square root of 25: 5.0
```

        System.out.println("num2: " + num2);
        System.out.println("text: " + text);
    }
}
```


🚀 To make things more exciting, you can use your favorite datatype such as `int`, `double`, or `String`! 🤩

But that's not all! 😎 You can also create a constant in Java using the `final` keyword:

**java code**

``` java
public class ConstantExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Creating a constant
        final double PI = 3.14;
        System.out.println("PI: " + PI);
    }
}
```

🔒 Constants are special because once they are assigned a value, their value cannot be changed throughout the program.

So, make sure to use constants when you have a value that needs to remain the same throughout your program! ⚙️

When creating variables and constants, it's important to choose names that are descriptive and meaningful. 💡

So go ahead, get creative and have fun with your variable and constant names! 🎉

![Operators in Java with Examples - Dot Net Tutorials](https://dotnettutorials.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Operators-in-Java-with-Examples.jpeg)

In Java, operators are special symbols that are used to perform operations on variables and values.  😎

## Arithmetic Operators

Arithmetic operators are used to perform basic mathematical operations.

| Operator | Name           | Example      |
|----------|----------------|--------------|
| ➕        | Addition       | 5 + 3 = 8    |
| ➖        | Subtraction    | 7 - 2 = 5    |
| ✖️        | Multiplication | 3 * 4 = 12   |
| ➗        | Division       | 10 / 2 = 5   |
| 📐        | Modulus        | 9 % 2 = 1    |

## Assignment Operators

Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables.
| Operator | Example    | Equivalent   |
|----------|------------|--------------|
| =        | x = 5      | x = 5        |
| +=       | x += 3     | x = x + 3    |
| -=       | x -= 2     | x = x - 2    |
| ✖️=       | x *= 4     | x = x * 4    |
| ➗=       | x /= 2     | x = x / 2    |
| 📐=       | x %= 3     | x = x % 3    |


## Comparison Operators

Comparison operators are used to compare values.
| Operator | Name                        | Example    |
|----------|-----------------------------|------------|
| ==       | Equal to                    | 5 == 5     |
| !=       | Not equal to                | 4 != 5     |
| >        | Greater than                | 6 > 3      |
| <        | Less than                   | 2 < 8      |
| >=       | Greater than or equal to    | 7 >= 7     |
| <=       | Less than or equal to       | 9 <= 10    |


## Logical Operators

Logical operators are used to combine conditional statements.

| Operator | Name | Example             |
|----------|------|---------------------|
| &&       | AND  | (5 > 3) && (8 < 10) |
| \|\|     | OR   | (5 > 3) \|\| (2 > 7) |
| !        | NOT  | !(5 > 3)            |

## Bitwise Operators

Bitwise operators are used to perform bitwise operations.

| Operator | Name                     | Example |
|----------|--------------------------|---------|
| &        | AND                      | 6 & 3   |
| \|       | OR                       | 6 \| 3  |
| ^        | XOR                      | 6 ^ 3   |
| ~        | NOT                      | ~6      |
| <<       | Left shift               | 6 << 2  |
| >>       | Right shift              | 6 >> 2  |
| >>>      | Zero fill right shift    | 6 >>> 2 |
