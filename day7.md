In the above code, we create an object of the `FileInputStream` class to open the input file and an object of the `BufferedReader` class to read the input from the file.

## 📤 Output Operations

### Writing Output to the Console

To write output to the console, we can use the `System.out` object in Java. Here's an example code to write output to the console:

**java code**

![](https://i.gyazo.com/ca2fa1b24311f16a026be99692a04800.png)


In the above code, we use the `println()` method of the `System.out` object to write the output to the console.

### Writing Output to a File

To write output to a file, we can use the `FileOutputStream` and `PrintWriter` classes in Java. Here's an example code to write output to a file:

**java code**


![](https://i.gyazo.com/6cb3402e5c389a5ac975c378f5a9ebc6.png)

# 🚀 Building Command-Line Programs in Java 🖥️ 🚀

Command-line programs are an essential part of many software development workflows. In Java, building command-line programs can be accomplished using the `main()` method in a class. This article will explore how to build command-line programs in Java, including taking input and providing output, and how to package and distribute them.

## 🤔 Understanding the `main()` Method

In Java, a command-line program is started by invoking the `main()` method of a class. The `main()` method takes an array of strings as an argument, which contains the command-line arguments passed to the program. Here is an example code:

**java code**

![](https://i.gyazo.com/4f66b57e51a28ed0fea60eb1aa4a5d16.png)


In the above code, we define a class with a `main()` method that simply prints "Hello, World!" to the console when invoked.

## 📥 Taking Input from Command-Line Arguments

To take input from command-line arguments in Java, we can use the `args` parameter passed to the `main()` method. Here is an example code:

**java code**

![](https://i.gyazo.com/41fafa059f476a6f3f67423f91a58e65.png)


In the above code, we use the `args` parameter to check if there are any command-line arguments passed to the program. If there are, we use the first argument to personalize the output to the user.

## 📤 Providing Output to the Command-Line

To provide output to the command-line in Java, we can use the `System.out` object and its `print()` and `println()` methods. Here is an example code:

**java code**

![](https://i.gyazo.com/35cc39ac0f327a49b7458d12d8dc7484.png)

` 

In the above code, we use a `for` loop to iterate through the `args` array and print each argument on a separate line.


## 📦 Packaging and Distributing Command-Line Programs

To package and distribute a command-line program in Java, we can use a build tool like Maven or Gradle. Here is an example `pom.xml` file for a Maven project:

**xml code**
