## üì• Input Operations

### Reading Input from Keyboard

To read input from the keyboard, we can use the `Scanner` class in Java. Here's an example code to read a string input from the keyboard:

**java code**


``` java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class ReadFromKeyboard {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.print("Enter a string: ");
        String inputString = scanner.nextLine();
        System.out.println("You entered: " + inputString);
        scanner.close();
    }
}
```



In the above code, we create an object of the `Scanner` class and use its `nextLine()` method to read the input string from the keyboard.

### Reading Input from a File

To read input from a file, we can use the `FileInputStream` and `BufferedReader` classes in Java. Here's an example code to read a file input in Java:

**java code**


``` java
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileInputStream;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;

public class ReadFromFile {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            File file = new File("input.txt");
            FileInputStream fileInputStream = new FileInputStream(file);
            BufferedReader bufferedReader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(fileInputStream));
            String line;
            while ((line = bufferedReader.readLine()) != null) {
                System.out.println(line);
            }
            fileInputStream.close();
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```



In the above code, we create an object of the `FileInputStream` class to open the input file and an object of the `BufferedReader` class to read the input from the file.

## üì§ Output Operations

### Writing Output to the Console

To write output to the console, we can use the `System.out` object in Java. Here's an example code to write output to the console:

**java code**

``` java
public class WriteToConsole {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```


In the above code, we use the `println()` method of the `System.out` object to write the output to the console.

### Writing Output to a File

To write output to a file, we can use the `FileOutputStream` and `PrintWriter` classes in Java. Here's an example code to write output to a file:

**java code**


``` java
import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileOutputStream;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.PrintWriter;

public class WriteToFile {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            File file = new File("output.txt");
            FileOutputStream fileOutputStream = new FileOutputStream(file);
            PrintWriter printWriter = new PrintWriter(fileOutputStream);
            printWriter.println("Hello, World!");
            printWriter.close();
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```



In the above code, we create an object of the `FileOutputStream` class to open the output file and an object of the `PrintWriter` class to write the output to the file.

## üìù Writing to a File

### Writing Text to a File

To write text to a file in Java, we can use the `PrintWriter` class. Here is an example code:

**java code**


``` java
import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileWriter;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.PrintWriter;

public class WriteTextToFile {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            File file = new File("output.txt");
            FileWriter fileWriter = new FileWriter(file);
            PrintWriter printWriter = new PrintWriter(fileWriter);
            printWriter.println("Hello, World!");
            printWriter.close();
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```



In the above code, we create an instance of the `PrintWriter` class, specify the file name and the character encoding, and then write to the file using the `println()` method.

### Writing Binary Data to a File

To write binary data to a file in Java, we can use the `FileOutputStream` class. Here is an example code:

**java code**


``` java
import java.io.DataOutputStream;
import java.io.FileOutputStream;
import java.io.IOException;

public class WriteBinaryToFile {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            FileOutputStream fileOutputStream = new FileOutputStream("data.bin");
            DataOutputStream dataOutputStream = new DataOutputStream(fileOutputStream);
            dataOutputStream.writeDouble(3.14159);
            dataOutputStream.writeInt(42);
            dataOutputStream.close();
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```



In the above code, we create an instance of the `FileOutputStream` class, and then wrap it with the `DataOutputStream` class to write binary data using methods like `writeDouble()` and `writeInt()`.

## üìñ Reading from a File

### Reading Text from a File

To read text from a file in Java, we can use the `BufferedReader` class. Here is an example code:

**java code**


``` java
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;

public class ReadTextFromFile {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            File file = new File("input.txt");
            FileReader fileReader = new FileReader(file);
            BufferedReader bufferedReader = new BufferedReader(fileReader);
            String line;
            while ((line = bufferedReader.readLine()) != null) {
                System.out.println(line);
            }
            bufferedReader.close();
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```



In the above code, we create an instance of the `BufferedReader` class, and then use the `readLine()` method to read each line of text from the file.

### Reading Binary Data from a File

To read binary data from a file in Java, we can use the `FileInputStream` class. Here is an example code:

**java code**


``` java
import java.io.DataInputStream;
import java.io.FileInputStream;
import java.io.IOException;

public class ReadBinaryFromFile {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            FileInputStream fileInputStream = new FileInputStream("data.bin");
            DataInputStream dataInputStream = new DataInputStream(fileInputStream);
            double doubleValue = dataInputStream.readDouble();
            int intValue = dataInputStream.readInt();
            dataInputStream.close();
            System.out.println("Double Value: " + doubleValue);
            System.out.println("Int Value: " + intValue);
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```


In the above code, we create an instance of the `FileInputStream` class, and then wrap it with the `DataInputStream` class to read binary data using methods like `readDouble()` and `readInt()`.

## üóëÔ∏è Deleting a File

To delete a file in Java, we can use the `File` class. Here is an example code:

**java code**


``` java
import java.io.File;

public class DeleteFile {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        File file = new File("fileToDelete.txt");
        if (file.delete()) {
            System.out.println("File deleted successfully.");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Failed to delete the file.");
        }
    }
}
```



In the above code, we create an instance of the `File` class and call the `delete()` method to delete the file. If the file is successfully deleted, the program prints a success message. Otherwise, it prints an error message.

## üìÇ Conclusion

In this article, we have explored different ways to perform file I/O operations in Java, including writing and reading text and binary data to and from files, as well as deleting files. File I/O is an essential part of many Java programs, and mastering it will make you a more efficient and effective Java developer.

# üíª Console I/O in Java üñ•Ô∏è üåà

Console I/O is essential in many Java programs, such as command-line utilities and games. In this article, we will explore different ways to perform Console I/O operations in Java.

![What is File I/O in Java? (Detailed) {2022} - CodeEaze](https://codeeaze.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/streams-in-java.png)



## üì• Reading Input from Console

To read input from the console in Java, we can use the `Scanner` class. Here is an example code:

**java code**


``` java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class ConsoleInputExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.println("Please enter your name: ");
        String name = scanner.nextLine();

        System.out.println("Please enter your age: ");
        int age = scanner.nextInt();

        System.out.println("Hello, " + name + ". You are " + age + " years old.");
        scanner.close();
    }
}
```


In the above code, we create an instance of the `Scanner` class and use its `nextLine()` method to read a line of input from the console.

## üì§ Writing Output to Console

To write output to the console in Java, we can use the `System.out` object and its `print()` and `println()` methods. Here is an example code:

**java code**

``` java
public class ConsoleOutputExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("This is an example of writing output to the console.");
    }
}
```


In the above code, we use the `println()` method to print a line of text to the console, and use the `print()` method to print text without a newline character.

## üìù Console Input and Output Combined

To combine console input and output in Java, we can use the `Scanner` class and the `System.out` object together. Here is an example code:

**java code**


``` java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class CombinedConsoleIOExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.println("Please enter a number: ");
        int number = scanner.nextInt();

        System.out.println("You entered: " + number);
        scanner.close();
    }
}
```


In the above code, we use both `Scanner` and `System.out` objects to read input and write output to the console.

## üåü Conclusion

In this article, we have explored different ways to perform Console I/O operations in Java, including reading input from the console, writing output to the console, and combining input and output operations. Console I/O is an essential part of many Java programs, and mastering it will make you a more efficient and effective Java developer.

# ü§ñ Interacting with Users through the Console in Java üñ•Ô∏è ü§ù
![Java IO Tutorial - GeeksforGeeks](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20210909153027/JavaIOConsole.png)

In Java, interacting with users through the console is a common way to take input and provide output in console-based applications. This article will explore different ways to interact with users through the console in Java, including taking input and providing output.

## üì• Taking Input from Users

To take input from users through the console in Java, we can use the `Scanner` class. Here is an example code:

**java code**


``` java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class InputExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        
        System.out.println("Please enter your name: ");
        String name = scanner.nextLine();

        System.out.println("Hello, " + name + "! Welcome to Java programming.");
        scanner.close();
    }
}
```



In the above code, we create an instance of the `Scanner` class and use its `nextLine()` method to read a line of input from the console. We then use the input to personalize the output to the user.

## üì§ Providing Output to Users

To provide output to users through the console in Java, we can use the `System.out` object and its `print()` and `println()` methods. Here is an example code:

**java code**

``` java
public class OutputExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("This is an example of providing output to users.");
    }
}
```

In the above code, we use the `println()` method to print a line of text to the console, and use the `print()` method to print text without a newline character.

## üé® Adding Color to Console Output

We can add color to console output in Java by using ANSI escape codes. Here is an example code:

**java code**

``` java
public class ConsoleColorExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("\u001B[31mThis text is red.\u001B[0m");
        System.out.println("\u001B[34mThis text is blue.\u001B[0m");
        System.out.println("\u001B[33mThis text is yellow.\u001B[0m");
    }
}
```


In the above code, we use ANSI escape codes to add color to console output.

## üåü Conclusion

In this article, we have explored different ways to interact with users through the console in Java, including taking input and providing output. We also learned how to add color to console output using ANSI escape codes. Interacting with users through the console is an essential part of many Java programs, and mastering it will make you a more efficient and effective Java developer.

# üöÄ Building Command-Line Programs in Java üñ•Ô∏è üöÄ
![Command-line arguments in C# with examples](https://www.includehelp.com/dot-net/images/command-line-argument-in-c-sharp.jpg)

Command-line programs are an essential part of many software development workflows. In Java, building command-line programs can be accomplished using the `main()` method in a class. This article will explore how to build command-line programs in Java, including taking input and providing output, and how to package and distribute them.

## ü§î Understanding the `main()` Method

In Java, a command-line program is started by invoking the `main()` method of a class. The `main()` method takes an array of strings as an argument, which contains the command-line arguments passed to the program. Here is an example code:

**java code**

``` java
public class MainMethodExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```


In the above code, we define a class with a `main()` method that simply prints "Hello, World!" to the console when invoked.

## üì• Taking Input from Command-Line Arguments

To take input from command-line arguments in Java, we can use the `args` parameter passed to the `main()` method. Here is an example code:

**java code**

``` java
public class CommandLineArgumentsExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        if (args.length > 0) {
            System.out.println("Hello, " + args[0] + "! Welcome to the program.");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Hello! Welcome to the program.");
        }
    }
}
```


In the above code, we use the `args` parameter to check if there are any command-line arguments passed to the program. If there are, we use the first argument to personalize the output to the user.

## üì§ Providing Output to the Command-Line

To provide output to the command-line in Java, we can use the `System.out` object and its `print()` and `println()` methods. Here is an example code:

**java code**

``` java
public class OutputToCommandLineExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        for (String arg : args) {
            System.out.println(arg);
        }
    }
}
```

In the above code, we use a `for` loop to iterate through the `args` array and print each argument on a separate line.


## üì¶ Packaging and Distributing Command-Line Programs

To package and distribute a command-line program in Java, we can use a build tool like Maven or Gradle. Here is an example `pom.xml` file for a Maven project:

**xml code**

``` xml
<project xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0" 
         xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
