# 💻 Installation of JDK and IDEs

Java Development Kit (JDK) and Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) are essential tools for Java developers. JDK contains everything you need to compile and run Java programs, while IDEs provide a user-friendly environment for coding and debugging.

## 📥 Installing JDK

To install JDK on your computer, follow these simple steps:

1.  Go to the <span style="color: #F8981D">[Oracle website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html)</span> and download the latest version of JDK for your operating system. 🌎
2.  Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation process.
3.  Once installed, set up the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable to point to the JDK installation directory.

Congratulations! You have now installed JDK on your computer. 🎉

## 🧑‍💻 Installing IDEs

There are several popular IDEs available for Java development, including Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, and NetBeans. Here's how to install Eclipse as an example:

1.  🌐 Go to the [Eclipse website](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/) and download the latest version of Eclipse IDE for Java Developers for your operating system.
2.  🚀 Extract the downloaded file to a directory of your choice.
3.  🎨 Run the `eclipse.exe` file to launch Eclipse.
4.  🌟 Once launched, create a new workspace and start coding!

That's it! You are now ready to start coding in Java using your preferred IDE. 😎

Remember, installing the necessary tools is just the first step in your journey to becoming a skilled Java developer. Keep practicing and learning, and you'll soon be creating amazing Java applications. 🌟

# 🛠️ Activities/Projects
## 🧑‍💻 Hello World program
### 🚀 Hello World in Java! 🌎

Get ready to write your first Java program! 🤖

## 📝 Writing the Code

Open your favorite text editor or integrated development environment (IDE) and create a new file called `HelloWorld.java`.

Type the following code into your file:

`![](https://i.gyazo.com/9beefe45808aa74f1bfa3b2d4ce21c2a.png)

This code creates a new class called `HelloWorld` with a main method that prints the message "Hello, world!" to the console.

## 🔨 Compiling and Running the Code

Save the file and open a terminal or command prompt.

Navigate to the directory where your `HelloWorld.java` file is located and type the following command to compile your code:

`javac HelloWorld.java` 

This will create a new file called `HelloWorld.class` in the same directory.

Now, run your program by typing the following command:

`java HelloWorld` 

This will execute your program and print the message "Hello, world!" to the console.

## 🎉 Congratulations!

You have successfully written and executed your first Java program! 🎊

Now that you have a basic understanding of how Java works, you can start exploring the language and building more complex applications. Happy coding! 💻
# 🤖 Introduction to Java syntax

Java is a programming language that is known for its simplicity and ease of use. In this guide, we'll introduce you to the basics of Java syntax, including:

## 📜 Data Types

Java has several built-in data types, including:

-   **int** - used for whole numbers
-   **double** - used for floating-point numbers
-   **boolean** - used for true/false values
-   **char** - used for individual characters
-   **String** - used for text

## 📝 Variables

Variables are used to store values in Java. To declare a variable, you need to specify the data type and give it a name:

`int age = 25;

double price = 9.99;

boolean isJavaFun = true;

char grade = 'A';

String message = "Hello, World!";` 

## ⚙️ Operators

Java has several operators that you can use to perform calculations and manipulate values, including:

-   **+** - addition
-   **-** - subtraction
-   ***** - multiplication
-   **/** - division
-   **%** - modulus (remainder)
-   **=** - assignment

## 🧮 Control Structures

Control structures are used to control the flow of your Java program. Some of the most common control structures include:

-   **if/else statements** - used to test conditions and execute code based on the results
-   **for loops** - used to iterate over a block of code a specific number of times
-   **while loops** - used to iterate over a block of code as long as a condition is true
-   **switch statements** - used to execute different blocks of code based on the value of a variable

## 📦 Classes and Objects

Java is an object-oriented programming language, which means that you can create classes and objects to organize your code. A class is a blueprint for creating objects, and an object is an instance of a class. Here's an example:
