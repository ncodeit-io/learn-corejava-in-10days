### 💻 Checked Exceptions 💻

Checked exceptions are the exceptions that are checked at compile-time. If a method throws a checked exception, the calling method must either handle the exception or declare it in the throws clause. Examples of checked exceptions include `IOException`, `SQLException`, and `ClassNotFoundException`.

### 🛠️ Example 🛠️

**java code**

### 💻 Unchecked Exceptions 💻

Unchecked exceptions are the exceptions that are not checked at compile-time. These exceptions are generally caused by errors in the program logic or system failures. Examples of unchecked exceptions include `NullPointerException`, `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`, and `ArithmeticException`.

### 🛠️ Example 🛠️

**java code**

### 💻 Errors 💻

Errors are exceptional conditions that are caused by the environment in which the application is running. Examples of errors include `StackOverflowError`, `OutOfMemoryError`, and `VirtualMachineError`.

### 🛠️ Example 🛠️

**java code**

## 💻 Try-Catch Blocks 💻

One way to handle exceptions in Java is by using try-catch blocks. A try block contains the code that may throw an exception, and a catch block handles the exception if it occurs. Here's the basic syntax:

**java code**

### 🛠️ Example 🛠️

Let's say you're writing a program that reads a file and you want to handle the exception that can occur if the file is not found. Here's how you can do it using a try-catch block:

**java code**

## 💻 Finally Block 💻

Another way to handle exceptions in Java is by using a finally block. A finally block contains code that is always executed, regardless of whether an exception is thrown or not. This can be useful for closing resources or cleaning up after an exception.

**java code**

### 🛠️ Example 🛠️

Let's say you're writing a program that opens a database connection and you want to ensure that the connection is closed, even if an exception occurs. Here's how you can do it using a try-catch-finally block:

**java code**

### 🚀 Conclusion 🚀

Handling exceptions in Java is crucial for writing robust and error-free programs. By using try-catch blocks and finally blocks, you can handle exceptions and ensure that your program continues to execute smoothly. So keep these techniques in mind when writing your Java programs! 👍

# 🚨 Creating Custom Exception Classes in Java 🚨

As a Java developer, you may encounter situations where the built-in exceptions don't quite fit your needs. In these cases, you can create your own custom exception classes to handle specific scenarios.

### 💻 Extending Exception Class 💻

To create a custom exception class in Java, you need to extend the `Exception` class. This will give your custom exception class all the functionality of a regular exception class, as well as any additional functionality that you define.

**java code**

![](https://i.gyazo.com/e2a24615b8235328e63476619ca40fb6.png)


### 🛠️ Example 🛠️

Let's say you're writing a program that calculates the area of a rectangle. You want to create a custom exception class that is thrown when the length or width of the rectangle is negative.

**java code**

![](https://i.gyazo.com/adf21ff63fd41af5a89ecf54e47c92f2.png)


Now you can use this custom exception class in your program, like this:

**java code**

## 💻 Extending Runtime Exception Class 💻

You can also create custom exception classes by extending the `RuntimeException` class. This is useful when you want to create exceptions that are unchecked and do not need to be declared in a `throws` clause.

**java code**

![](https://i.gyazo.com/5e38bc71528713cb84b7755b3d70901f.png)


### 🛠️ Example 🛠️

Let's say you're writing a program that divides two numbers. You want to create a custom runtime exception class that is thrown when the divisor is zero.

**java code**

![](https://i.gyazo.com/7c2c1d0e2edc5a3d4dc9db6990307b62.png)


Now you can use this custom runtime exception class in your program, like this:

**java code**

![](https://i.gyazo.com/36f468831517d2a260d3d22014761d7d.png)

 

### 🚀 Conclusion 🚀

Creating custom exception classes in Java can help you handle specific scenarios that are not covered by the built-in exceptions. By extending the `Exception` or `RuntimeException` class, you can define your own exceptions with custom functionality. So keep these techniques in mind when writing your Java programs! 👍

# 🚨 Summary of  Exception Handling in Java 🚨

Exception handling in Java is a critical feature that helps prevent unexpected errors and allows you to handle errors gracefully. Here's a more detailed explanation of the topic:

### 💥 The Try-Catch Block

To handle an exception in Java, you use a try-catch block. The `try` block contains the code that may throw an exception, and the `catch` block catches the exception and provides a way to handle it. The `finally` block is optional and contains the code that executes whether or not an exception is thrown.

### 💣 Throw and Throws

In addition to try-catch-finally, there are two other keywords that are commonly used in exception handling: `throw` and `throws`. The `throw` keyword is used to explicitly throw an exception in a program, and the `throws` keyword is used to declare the exceptions that a method may throw.

### 🎭 Types of Exceptions

Java has a hierarchy of exception classes, with the base class being the `Throwable` class. The two main types of exceptions in Java are checked and unchecked exceptions. Checked exceptions are checked at compile time and must be handled or declared, whereas unchecked exceptions are not checked at compile time and do not need to be handled or declared.

### 🌟 Custom Exception Classes

You can create your own custom exception classes in Java by extending the `Exception` or `RuntimeException` class. This can be useful when you want to create your own exception types that are specific to your application or domain.

💡 Remember, when handling exceptions, it's important to handle them gracefully and provide helpful error messages to the user. By using try-catch blocks, throw and throws keywords, and custom exception classes, you can create robust Java programs that handle errors with ease.

# 🚀 Applications of Exception Handling in Java 🚀

Exception handling is an essential feature of Java programming that allows developers to handle errors and exceptions that can occur during program execution. Let's explore some of the common applications of exception handling in Java:

### 🔍 Debugging 🔍

When a Java program encounters an error, it often terminates abruptly, leaving developers guessing about the cause of the error. Exception handling allows developers to catch and handle these errors in a controlled manner, providing them with the necessary information to identify and fix the problem.

### 🧹 Cleanup 🧹

When working with resources such as files, databases, and network connections, it's important to properly close them when they're no longer needed. Exception handling can be used to ensure that these resources are closed even if an error occurs during program execution.

### 🚦 Flow Control 🚦

In some cases, errors may occur during program execution that can't be handled locally. In these situations, exception handling can be used to transfer control to a higher level of the program, allowing it to take appropriate action.

### 🧪 Testing 🧪

Exception handling can also be used to test the robustness of a program by intentionally triggering errors and exceptions. This allows developers to identify and fix potential problems before the program is deployed.

Overall, exception handling is a powerful feature of Java programming that allows developers to write more robust and reliable programs. By using exception handling, developers can ensure that their programs handle errors and exceptions in a graceful and controlled manner.
