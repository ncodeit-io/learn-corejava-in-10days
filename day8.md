## 🌟 Collections Hierarchy 🌟

The Collections Framework in Java consists of several different types of interfaces and classes, each designed for a specific use case. These include:

| Interface  | Description                                                                                     |
|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Collection | 📦 The root of the collections hierarchy that defines the basic behavior of all collection classes |
| Set        | 🃏 A collection that contains no duplicate elements                                               |
| List       | 📜 An ordered collection (sometimes called a sequence)                                            |
| Queue      | 🚶‍♂️ A collection used to hold elements prior to processing                                          |
| Deque      | 🚪 A double-ended queue that supports insertion and removal at both ends                          |


## 🌟 Map Interface 🌟

The Map interface 🗺️ is also part of the Collection Framework, but it is not technically a collection. It represents a mapping between a key and a value.

## 🌟 Benefits of using Collection Framework 🌟

-   The Collection Framework provides a standard way to organize and manipulate collections of objects in Java.
-   It allows developers to choose the most appropriate data structure for their needs.
-   It reduces the amount of code required to work with collections.
-   It is highly efficient, providing excellent performance for large data sets.

So, start using the Collection Framework in Java today and organize your data like a pro! 🚀

# 🎉 Collection in Java 🎉

Collection in Java is the foundation of the Java Collections Framework. It provides a standard way to organize and manipulate groups of related objects.

## 💻 Examples

Let's take a look at some code examples to better understand how Collections work in Java.

**java code**


![](https://i.gyazo.com/41f10a2572a72fc9cd6a69e92d484eee.png)


In this example, we imported the ArrayList class and created an ArrayList of Strings called `names`. We added three names to the list and printed out the contents of the list using `System.out.println()`.

### Iterating over a Collection

To iterate over the elements of a Collection, you can use a for-each loop. Here's an example of iterating over the names ArrayList we created earlier:

**java code**

![](https://i.gyazo.com/9c3feb06a3a2a6350eeb9f7d1a606b5c.png)
 

In this example, we used a for-each loop to iterate over the elements in the `names` ArrayList and print out each name to the console.

### Removing elements from a Collection

To remove an element from a Collection, you can use the `remove()` method. Here's an example of removing an element from the `names` ArrayList:

**java code**

![](https://i.gyazo.com/a056ac3a55c374f1db611874e623f69f.png)



In this example, we used the `remove()` method to remove the name "Bob" from the `names` ArrayList.

# 🚶‍♂️ Queue in Java 🚶‍♀️

In Java, a Queue 🚶‍♂️ is a collection that is used to hold elements prior to processing. It follows the FIFO (First-In-First-Out) principle, meaning that the element that is added first is the one that will be removed first.

## 💻 Examples

Let's take a look at some code examples to better understand how Queues work in Java.

### Creating a Queue

To create a Queue, you can use any of the Queue classes provided in Java. Here's an example of creating a LinkedList:

### Removing Elements from a Queue

To remove an element from a Queue, you can use the `remove()` or `poll()` method. Here's an example of removing an element from the `queue` LinkedList:

**java code**

![](https://i.gyazo.com/a8a8e5f99bdb1409024519d75329ecb9.png)


In this example, we used the `remove()` method to remove the first element in the `queue` LinkedList (which is "Alice"). We then printed out a friendly greeting to Alice using `System.out.println()`.

The `poll()` method works the same as `remove()`, except that it returns null if the Queue is empty.

### 🌟 Conclusion

In conclusion, Queues in Java provide a way to manage elements in a First-In-First-Out order. By using the Queue classes provided in Java, you can easily create, access, and remove elements from the Queue to suit your needs. So start using Queues in your Java code today and make your code more efficient! 🚀

# 🚪 Deque in Java 🚪

In Java, a Deque 🚪 is a double-ended queue that supports insertion and removal at both ends. It is pronounced "deck", short for "double-ended queue". Deques are similar to Queues, but they allow elements to be added and removed from both the front and the back of the queue.

## 💻 Examples

Let's take a look at some code examples to better understand how Deques work in Java.

### Creating a Deque

To create a Deque, you can use any of the Deque classes provided in Java. Here's an example of creating an ArrayDeque:

![](https://i.gyazo.com/199e1c94cdf0ee660a0195fedc0f6cb7.png)


In this example, we imported the ArrayDeque class and created an ArrayDeque of Strings called `deque`. We added three names to the Deque using the `addFirst()` and `addLast()` methods, and printed out the contents of the Deque using `System.out.println()`.

### Removing Elements from a Deque

To remove an element from a Deque, you can use the `removeFirst()` or `removeLast()` method. Here's an example of removing an element from the `deque` ArrayDeque:

**java code**

![](https://i.gyazo.com/cb77bdd46ecb142e1ed0701b16e8c62f.png)


In this example, we used the `removeFirst()` method to remove the first element in the `deque` ArrayDeque (which is "Alice"). We then printed out a friendly greeting to Alice using `System.out.println()`.

### 🌟 Conclusion

In conclusion, Deques in Java provide a way to manage elements in a double-ended queue. By using the Deque classes provided in Java, you can easily create, access, and remove elements from the Deque to suit your needs. So start using Deques in your Java code today and make your code more versatile! 🚪

# Maps in Java 🗺️

Maps in Java are a collection of key-value pairs, where each key is unique and maps to a corresponding value. Java provides several implementations of the Map interface, including HashMap, TreeMap, LinkedHashMap, and ConcurrentHashMap. Maps are used to store and manipulate data in a way that allows for efficient lookup and retrieval of values based on their associated keys.

## HashMap 🗃️

HashMap is an implementation of the Map interface in Java that uses a hash table to store its elements. It provides constant-time performance for basic operations such as adding, removing, and accessing elements. Here's an example of using HashMap in Java:

**java code**


![](https://i.gyazo.com/2397b889a78552ee656b5474d01b1114.png)

In this example, we create a new HashMap object called `ageMap` that maps strings (names) to integers (ages). We add three key-value pairs to the map using the `put` method, and then retrieve and print the ages of each person using the `get` method.

## TreeMap 🌳

TreeMap is another implementation of the Map interface in Java that uses a red-black tree to store its elements in sorted order. It provides guaranteed log(n) time cost for basic operations such as adding, removing, and accessing elements. Here's an example of using TreeMap in Java:

**java code**


![](https://i.gyazo.com/36e9927f75624bd9d8b7f9165775126b.png)


In this example, we create a new TreeMap object called `ageMap` that maps strings (names) to integers (ages). We add three key-value pairs to the map using the `put` method, and then retrieve and print the ages of each person using the `get` method. The elements are automatically sorted in ascending order based on the keys.

## LinkedHashMap 🧩

LinkedHashMap is another implementation of the Map interface in Java that maintains the order in which its elements were added. It provides constant-time performance for basic operations such as adding, removing, and accessing elements, but slightly slower than HashMap due to the additional overhead of maintaining the insertion order. Here's an example of using LinkedHashMap in Java:

**java code**

# Summary - Collection Framework in Java 📦

In Java, the Collection Framework 📦 is a set of classes and interfaces that provides an organized way of storing and manipulating objects. The Collection Framework defines a hierarchy of interfaces and classes that represent different types of collections, such as Lists, Sets, and Queues.

#### 🔑 Key Interfaces and Classes

The Collection Framework is built around a few key interfaces and classes:

-   📦`Collection`: The root interface in the Collection Framework that defines the basic behavior of all collection classes.
-  📜 `List`: An ordered collection (sometimes called a sequence).
-  🃏 `Set`: A collection that contains no duplicate elements.
-   🚶‍♂️`Queue`: A collection used to hold elements prior to processing.
-   🚪`Deque`: A double-ended queue that supports insertion and removal at both ends.
-   🗺️`Map`: A collection that maps keys to values.📜


# 📦 Applications of Collection Framework in Java 📦

The Collection Framework in Java 📦 is widely used in many applications to store and manipulate data. The framework provides a set of classes and interfaces that can be used to manage collections of objects. Here are some examples of how the Collection Framework can be applied in Java.

### 📊 Data Analysis

The Collection Framework can be used for data analysis tasks, such as counting occurrences of items in a dataset or computing the average of a set of values. For example, you could use a HashMap to count the number of occurrences of each item in a list, or a TreeSet to sort a set of values in ascending order.

### 🖥️ User Interfaces

The Collection Framework can be used to store and manage data in user interfaces. For example, you could use a List to store the items in a drop-down menu, or a Set to store the items in a multi-select list. You could also use a Map to store the settings for a user's preferences.

### 🎲 Game Development

The Collection Framework can be used in game development to manage game data. For example, you could use a List to store the players in a game, or a Queue to manage the order of player turns. You could also use a Map to store the scores of each player.

### 🏭 Enterprise Applications

The Collection Framework can be used in enterprise applications to manage data in databases or data warehouses. For example, you could use a List to store the results of a database query, or a Set to store unique values in a column. You could also use a Map to store the data in a key-value pair format.
